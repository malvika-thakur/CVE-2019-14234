The vulnerability requires the developer to use JSONField/HStoreField; moreover, the field name of the queryset can be controlled. Django's built-in application Django-Admin is affected, which gives us an easy way to reproduce the vulnerability.

# Start Vulnerability Application
Compile and start a vulnerable Django 2.2.3 by executing the following command:

docker compose build
docker compose up -d
